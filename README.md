This script does a few things that I needed done.

- go through a list of torrent files
- determine the dir name associated with that torrent 
- move the torrent file to your watch folder
- move the downloaded torrent directory (if you have it already downloaded) into your torrent program's download directory

Check out YouTube video of the script in action, much excite, such script, how pirating.
